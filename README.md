## Overview

### The challenge

### What I learned

Through this project I learned a lot about routing in React, context and reducers, useParams, useEffect and a couple of other React functionalities. I also learned how to create custom hooks and theme/color toggle in React.

### Continued Learning

I intend to expand my knowledge In React by practicing more with the Context api and other complex React functionalities
